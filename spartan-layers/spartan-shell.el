;; `shell' is the preferred spartan-emacs shell because eshell and ansi/multi/term are all too buggy.
;; `shell' is a bash process attached to a buffer, so it has all of Emacs bindings, etc. That's perfect.

;; If you really need ncurses, you're probably doing it wrong.
;; But the best bet is to install libvterm and enable the vterm layer.
;; M-x vterm is for occasions when you can't get away from ncurses.
