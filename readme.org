** QUICK INSTALL

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git clone https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
   #+END_SRC

*** FEATURES

    - Simple, clean configuration and a comprehensible layers system
    - No third party packages install by default
    - Prefer built-ins
    - Use lightweight, mostly-vanilla configured layer packages
    - Doesn't mess with use-package, deferral, the pdumper -- doesn't care about start time
    - Tested on Linux, but should work also work fine on any gnu/bsd/macos base
    - Tuned for [[https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs/blob/master/spartan-layers/spartan-performance.el][ultimate performance]] using the latest *pgtk* *gccemacs* with native *json* parsing with *eglot* language server protocol  (not required, just recommended)

*** LAYERS

    - Edit init.el and M-x spartan-reconfigure

**** HOW LAYERS WORK

    - Enabled layer packages are installed during init
    - Then layer packages are configured in the after-init-hook
    - Finally layer packages may be user local customized in spartan.d/

      (all lisp files in spartan.d/ load last, during the emacs-startup-hook)

*** LANGUAGES PRECONFIGURED

    - Lisp/Scheme
    - Bash
    - Python
    - PR's accepted :)

*** HOW TO HACK

    - Fork repo, clone it, own it

*** HOW TO UPDATE

    - *git pull*

    - *M-x package-list-packages* => *U* => *x*

*** BINDS

    - Default emacs binds (unless you enable evil)

    - Principally, we want to use short M-x aliases, while also putting global function binds on C-c and
      language specific binds on M-m prefixes

    - Do look at [[https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs/blob/master/spartan-layers/spartan-binds-global.el][spartan-binds-global.el]] to get
      the general idea,

      M-x ff (find files) ,
      M-x rg (rgrep files) ,
      M-x kr (browse-kill-ring) ,
      M-x ed (ediff) ,
      M-x git (magit) ,
      M-x lint (flymake) ,
      M-x pb (webpaste) ,
      M-x sh (better-shell) ,
      <f5> (compile) ,
      <f6> (script execute) ...

    - Also see [[https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs/blob/master/spartan-layers/spartan-eglot.el][spartan-eglot.el]] for language-server-protocol binds

    - And for language-specific files, see relevant language file e.g. [[https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs/blob/master/spartan-layers/spartan-python.el][spartan-python.el]]
